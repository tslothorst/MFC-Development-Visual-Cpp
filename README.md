# MFC Development using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0

This is the source code supplied on the companion CD-ROM with the book "MFC Development using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0" from the Microsoft Mastering series. I'm not the author or the owner of this code, it's made by Microsoft and the authors of the book. I've decided to upload this code since most people by now will have lost their companion CD-ROM or some people might buy this book second hand without the CD-ROM being included. Having the source code is convient if you want to code along with the book since important files like the resource files are not always reproduced in text in the book itself. 

The source code is posted "as-is", these are Visual C++ 6 projects and you might not be able to open the workspace in any modern Visual Studio version. Some of the examples might not compile anymore or might not be the greatest idea to copy-paste into your production application.
